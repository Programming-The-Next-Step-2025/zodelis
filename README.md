# zodelis
This is a lithuanian version of Wordle, the famous New York Times game.

In this game you have to guess a lithuanian word that consists of 5 letters.
You have 5 guesses.

A single guess consists of a random lithuanian 5 letter word.
After each guess you can see whether you guessed any letter right or
if you guessed any letter and location right. Based on this feedback
you can continue guessing until you (hopefully) get it right!

Could be a (extremely difficult) way to learn lithuanian.
